# Memory Game

This project implements the classic memory game.

The game ends when the player matches all the cards. At the moment, eigth pairs of cards have been definied but this can be easily change in the code.

During all the game the player can see a star rating, the total moves made and the time that has passed since the game started.

Once the game is finished, the score is shown including moves, time and star rating. At the same moment, the user is asked if he/she wants to play again.

At any moment of the game, the game can be started by clicking at the refresh icon below the board.
